# spam-classification

## Overview
Comparison of the performance of three supervised machine learning algorithms: decision tree, random forest, and naive Bayes, in detecting and filtering out spam emails.

## Summary
The random forest classifier demonstrated the highest effectiveness, achieving an F1 measure value of approximately 97%, outperforming both the decision tree (~93%) and naive Bayes classifier (~95%). These results affirm that employing more advanced machine learning methods with a greater number of input features leads to improved performance in spam classification tasks.
